4.	Create a function that returns a new array containing the square roots of each number in the original array [1,4,9,16,25]
(Math.sqrt())
5.	Write a function that prints the number 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print Buzz. For the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz(write the code in the browser’s snippet and invoke the function inside the console)
